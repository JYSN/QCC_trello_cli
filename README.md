# QCC Trello CLI
## A Word
This is  a work in progress and likely not yet functional.
## Name & Purpose
This is a subproject of Quarantine Coding Club (QCC), aimed at creating a command line interface for the Trello boards we use to keep our goals in sync.
Should it become more useful or gain additional users in the future, a more clever name will be considered at the time, as will (witty) suggestions.
## Basic functionality
At present the goal is to get a simple CLI that grabs card titles off the ToDo stack on Trello.

### Future Features / Roadmap
- [ ]  CLI Print of items in `To Do` column
- [ ]  Details from each card
- [ ]  User selectable Actions for each card
    - Show card
    - Mark as in-progress (move to `in progress` list)
    - Mark as done (move to `done` list)
- [ ]  Additional card views
    - togglable `Done, In-Progress, To Do` & `Coming Up` columns
    - Search for cards (name or description)
    - filter by fields (labels, due dates, etc)
